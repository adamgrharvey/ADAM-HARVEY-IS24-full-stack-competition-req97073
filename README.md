# Adam Harvey - IS24 Full Stack Developer Position Challenge

My project meets all mandatory and bonus criteria mentioned in the challenge description!

Please let me know if you run into issues running the app, or editing it while you are testing it. I will gladly help!

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo to your desired location. `git clone https://github.com/adamgrharvey/ADAM-HARVEY-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073.git`
- Navigate to the `'competition-app'` directory. From the directory you cloned the repo to: `cd ADAM-HARVEY-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073/competition-app`
- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- The app utilizes Express JS for the API component, and React for the frontend component. This requires two console instances running. While I have set the `npm start` script to run the React server on port 3001, run the Express server first, and then run the React app to avoid potential unforeseen issues.
- In the first console window, start the Express server (using command `node server.js`).
- In the second console, start the React app (using command `npm start`).
